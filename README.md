# Advice Generator
The Advice Generator is a simple web application that generates random advice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
# Usage
To use the Advice Generator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Click the "Get Advice" button to generate a new piece of advice. You can click the button as many times as you like to get more advice.

# Features
The Advice Generator uses a simple JavaScript function to generate random advice from a list of pre-defined advice statements. The statements are displayed on the screen using HTML and CSS, and are styled to be easy to read and visually appealing.
